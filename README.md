redcap-integrity
================

A simple tool to monitor the amount of missing data in your REDCap databases.

Why?
----

If you use REDCap to run large projects, there will invariably be records for which you do not collect an entire dataset. Hopefully this because of systematic problems in your research program, but rather only due to random chance.

This repo will provide tools to help you keep track of the amount of missing data over time, hopefully helping to squash bugs in your data collection process before they become real issues.
